## Difference
- MMJR is based off Uzuy. It may give better performance on lowned and higher end devices. It also supports [custom mali drivers](https://github.com/uzuy-emul/MaliDrivers).
- Edge is based off yuzu. It moves things to accuracy instead of performance and is the more stable version, but still, it is in early beta.
